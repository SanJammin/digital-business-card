                I live for the rhythm — whether I’m dropping bars on stage or spinning the wheels of steel. 
                I’ve got a deep appreciation for aged cheddar, fine drip, and late-night studio vibes. 
                When I’m not collaborating with the realest in the game, you’ll catch me curating the ultimate cheese board, 
                perfecting my mic technique, or building my cheddar empire one slice at a time. Stay smooth. Stay cheesy.
